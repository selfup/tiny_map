// Package tinymap provides a simple to use interface that behaves like a HashMap.
// Multiple "Maps" are exposed for use as well as structs that behave like "Tuples".
// This package is intended to be used with tinygo, but has some nice little structs.
// Feel free to use this as you wish. It is very small, but helps with embedded programming.
package tinymap
